# Conjugator-Software
A program that conjugates any arbitrary German verb and creates a PDF from it.
It first reads the verb lists that are stored as .txt files in the folder "shemes"
It compares the user input with these lists to find irregular verbs.
If there is no match found it starts to take the input and matches it against other filter values like the ending of the word.
After determining the type of verb it creates a PDF with the results.
